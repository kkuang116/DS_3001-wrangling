The abstract states that because tidy datasets are structured in a specific way, they are easier to manipulate and offer an advantage due to their consistent structure. Examples and a case study are provided within the paper to reinforce the author's ideas.\n",

The tidy datasets and tools work together to provide users with a simpler experience when it comes to trying to figure out the organization/logistical components of a dataset. Having a standard makes it easier to clean the initial data because the process can be similar each time.\n",
